# Biography

I am  prospective PhD student at the Department of Political Science at the Central European University (CEU). My research interests span from voting behaviour, methodology, to political communication. Methods wise, I am particularly interested in graphical causal models, machine learning algorithms, text analysis, and big data. 

I am currently external consultant and analysis for Intellectual Themes Initiative at CEU and for the European Consortium for Political Research Summer and Winter Schools for Methods and Techniques. 

I am the vice president of the CEU Populism Research Group (POPRES) and member of the survey and experimental teams of Team Populism, a research group that brings together renowned scholars from Europe and the Americas to study the causes and consequences of populism.

I love cooking, films, games, reading about tech stuff, and programming. Huge Linux fan boy.
