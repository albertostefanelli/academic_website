# Biography

I am a FWO PhD Fellow at the [Institute for Social and Political Opinion Research (ISPO)](https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso/ispo), KU Leuven, Belgium. I am currently working on the questionnaire design and data collection for the Belgian National Electoral Study (BNES) and the Belgian Ethnic Minorities Election Study (BEMES).

My research interests are mostly within the field of public opinion, voting behaviour, and attitudes towards democracy. My PhD is on radical belief systems, conditionality of liberal values, and polarisation. 

Methods wise, I am particularly interested in conjoint analysis, matching and standardization techniques, graphical causal models, machine learning, and big data. 

I am a member of the survey and experimental teams of [Team Populism](http://www.teampopulism.com/), a research group that brings together renowned scholars from Europe and the Americas to study the causes and consequences of populism.

Concerning the private sector, I am an external consultant and analyst for [ZK Analytics](http://www.zkanalytics.com/) and for the [European Consortium for Political Research (Methods Schools)](https://ecpr.eu/Events/EventTypeDetails.aspx?EventTypeID=5). 

I love cooking, woodworking, and reading about how individuals make choices. Huge Linux fan boy.
