# Biography

I am a prospective PhD candidate at the [Centre for Sociological Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso) at KU Leuven, Belgium. My research interests are mostly within the filed of voting behaviour, party finance, and political communication. Methods wise, I am particularly interested in graphical causal models, machine learning algorithms, text analysis, and big data. 

I am member of the survey and experimental teams of [Team Populism](http://www.teampopulism.com/), a research group that brings together renowned scholars from Europe and the Americas to study the causes and consequences of populism.

Concerning the private sector, I am currently external consultant and analyst for [ZK Analytics](http://www.zkanalytics.com/) and for the [European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) methods schools](https://ecpr.eu/Events/EventTypeDetails.aspx?EventTypeID=5). 


I love cooking, films, games, reading about tech stuff, and programming. Huge Linux/Unix fan boy.
